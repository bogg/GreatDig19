With this toolchain, you can develop and deploy a Cloud Foundry application. By default, the toolchain uses a sample Node.js Hello World app, but you can link to your own GitHub repository instead. This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery, source control, issue tracking, and online editing.
